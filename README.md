# Pipeline‑flow

**Pipeline‑flow** is a full‑stack project that integrates backend and frontend components to create a seamless data-processing pipeline application.

## 🧭 Project Structure

```
Pipeline‑flow/
├── backend/          # Backend services (Python / Node.js / etc.)
├── frontend/         # Web UI (React, Vue, or similar)
└── README.md         # Project overview and setup instructions
```

## 🚀 Features

- Modular data-processing pipeline architecture  
- APIs to ingest, transform, and output data  
- Interactive frontend to visualize pipeline flows  
- Error handling  
- Cross-platform with containerization options

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x or Node.js (as required by the backend)  
- npm or yarn for frontend  
- `virtualenv` or `venv` for Python environments  
- Git

### 🔧 Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Git Bash on Windows
# or: source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or: npm install  # if backend is JS-based
```

To start the server:

```bash
python app.py
# or: npm start
```

### 💻 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Then open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Usage

1. Start the backend server to expose API routes
2. Start the frontend client to view and manage the pipeline
3. Use the UI to build, run, and monitor your pipelines

## 📁 Directory Breakdown

### backend/
Handles all server-side logic:
- API endpoint routing
- Pipeline business logic
- Data transformation operations

### frontend/
Client-side logic and UI:
- React/Vue components
- Visual editor and dashboard
- Frontend API integration

## 🎯 Goal & Vision

This project aims to provide a visual and programmable interface for creating, running, and managing pipeline flows. It's built to be developer-friendly, customizable, and scalable.
